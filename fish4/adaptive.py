"""Playing style that responds to the match, rather than one fixed objective.

Every objective term in v0.4 is a function of a candidate ask and the posterior.
None of them knows the score, and none of them knows that the last four moves
were the same two players passing one card back and forth. Two ideas here, both
ablatable to zero, both measurable on their own.

1. THE DUEL, AND WHETHER TO BREAK IT
------------------------------------
``perpetual.py`` establishes that the state graph is cyclic precisely because two
opponents can trade a card back and forth forever. It treats that as a fact about
the rules. What it does not ask is whether a *player* should enter such a trade.

The greedy answer is obviously yes: a card you just watched an opponent take from
you is a card you know they hold, so asking for it back is a certain ask, and a
certain ask keeps your turn. Descending probability is how you bank the most
cards before a miss, and re-taking is the top of that order by construction.

The case against is not about this turn. It is that the exchange is *public*, and
repeating it tells the table that this half-suit is contested and that both of
you are still in it - while gaining neither side a net card across the cycle. A
player who breaks the pattern spends a certain ask now in exchange for the
opponents learning less about where the suit lives.

``w_retake`` prices that. It is a penalty on an ask that would take back a card
this seat lost to that same opponent inside a recent window. Set it to zero and
the policy is the incumbent, exactly.

We expect this to lose. The scheduling argument says the certain ask should come
first, and v0.4 already reports its two information terms (``reveal``,
``signal``) as nulls. It is worth measuring anyway, because those two terms are
*static* per-ask features while this one is a fact about the recent history, and
because "hold the card back" is a thing strong human players describe doing and
the engine currently cannot express at all.

2. THE SCORE
------------
The champion plays a 5-1 lead exactly as it plays a 1-5 deficit. That is unlikely
to be right. A team that is behind needs variance and should prefer the ask that
resolves the most uncertainty even at a lower success probability; a team that is
ahead wants the game to end and should prefer certainty and early claims.

``w_behind`` scales the tie-breakers by the score differential: positive values
make a losing team play for information and a winning team play safe. At zero the
weights are the incumbent's constants and nothing changes.

Both quantities are computed from the public record and this seat's own hand.
Nothing here reads a layout.

    ``min_depth`` gates the penalty on the exchange being RECURRING. At 0 --
    the default, and what every measurement so far used -- every retake is
    flagged, including the first one.

    That default does not match the argument in this module's docstring, and
    noticing the mismatch is the only reason this parameter exists. The case
    against re-taking is about a repeated public exchange teaching the table
    that a half-suit is contested while neither side nets a card across the
    cycle. None of that applies to the FIRST retake: taking back a card you
    just watched leave your hand is a certain ask, it keeps your turn, and it
    reveals nothing the table did not just witness. Penalising it is paying the
    cost of the theory without being in the situation the theory describes.

    Five screening cells measured the ungated version and all five lost, two of
    them decisively and monotonically in the penalty. That is what the theory
