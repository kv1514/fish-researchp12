"""FishBot v0.4: exact-posterior play with a wide, ablatable ask objective.

Relationship to v0.3
--------------------
v0.3's strongest policy sampled 32 worlds from a *biased* sampler, scored asks
as ``P(success) + 0.06*depth + 0.6*turn_risk + 0.2*scarcity``, and claimed at a
fixed 0.97 confidence. Its own diagnosis was that the objective, not the depth
of search, was the binding constraint, and that belief precision had not
saturated (32 -> 96 samples was still worth +0.54 sets per deal-pair).

v0.4 changes three things and holds everything else fixed so the changes are
attributable:

1. **Inference.** Marginals come from exact combinatorial counting over the
   candidate-mask and quota system rather than from a heuristic sampler, with
   the OR constraints handled by a correction whose error is measured rather
   than assumed. See ``counting.py`` and ``posterior.py``.
2. **Objective.** Ten ablatable terms instead of three, all computed from the
   marginals in one vectorised pass. See ``askfeat.py``.
3. **Claiming.** The declared distribution is the exact posterior MAP, not the
   mode of 32 samples, and forced claims maximise expected sets rather than
   confidence. See ``claim4.py``.

Everything an acting policy touches comes from the Observation plus this seat's
own BeliefState, which is derived from public events and this seat's own hand.
``GameState`` is never visible here.
