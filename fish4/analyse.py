"""The analysis engine: what FishBot v0.4 thinks about a position.

This is the layer that makes the engine usable rather than merely strong. A
chess engine hands you an evaluation, a ranked move list and a principal
variation; the same three things exist here, they just mean something
different in a game whose hidden state is the whole problem.

**Evaluation.** In sets, from the acting seat's team's point of view. The
banked differential plus, for every unresolved half-suit, the learned
probability that our team ends up scoring it minus the probability that
theirs does (``hsvalue.py``). So ``+1.4`` reads as "we expect to finish 1.4
sets ahead of where the score already is". The model is calibrated against
outcomes rather than asserted: mean bias -0.006, reliable in every decile.

**Move list.** Every legal ask, with the probability it lands (which the
measurements say is the dominant term and not one consideration among
several), the change in evaluation it produces on each branch, and the
per-term breakdown of the policy's own score so a disagreement with the
engine can be attributed to a term rather than left as a mystery.

**Principal variation.** In chess the PV is the expected line. Here the
analogous object is the *possession*: the chain of asks the engine would make
if each one landed, which is what actually decides a turn in Fish. The chain is
computed by pinning each card as it is won and re-ranking, so it is the
engine's actual plan rather than a static list.

Two things a chess engine does not have to report, and this one must:

**The card table.** The posterior over who holds every unresolved card. This is
where the engine's strength lives, so it is shown, not hidden.

**The claim table.** For each live half-suit, the probability our team holds all
six, the most likely distribution among us, and the exact probability that
distribution is right - which is the number the claim decision turns on.

INFORMATION BOUNDARY: everything here is computed from an ``Observation`` plus
the seat's own belief state. The analyser can be pointed at any seat, but it
only ever sees what that seat is entitled to see.
