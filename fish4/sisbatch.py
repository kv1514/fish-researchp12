"""Vectorised batch drawing for the sequential importance sampler.

WHY
---
Profiling the v0.4 policy showed a single function, ``SISSampler._attempt``,
taking 67% of total runtime (24.9s of 37.4s over three games). That is
unsurprising: it is a tight Python loop over roughly 26 cards, run 128 times per
decision and roughly 110 times per game, so it executes several hundred thousand
times per game.

The loop is sequential *within* a draw but completely independent *across*
draws, so the whole batch can advance one card at a time with every draw
progressing in lockstep. Each card then costs a handful of numpy operations on
``(N, 6)`` arrays instead of ``N`` passes of scalar Python. The proposal
distribution is unchanged - this is the same algorithm, executed differently -
and ``tests4/test_sisbatch.py`` asserts that by comparing the realised
distribution against the analytic path density that the scalar implementation is
already validated against.

DEAD ENDS
---------
A draw can paint itself into a corner (a card with no candidate that still has
quota, or two clauses demanding the same card for different players). In the
scalar sampler that triggers a restart. Here such draws are simply marked dead
and dropped from the batch; the caller may top up. Both are the same
conditioning-on-success, which multiplies every density by the same constant and
so leaves self-normalised weights unaffected. The measured dead-end rate on real
positions is zero in 10,050 draws, so this path is a safety net rather than a
hot one.
