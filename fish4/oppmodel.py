"""Inferring hidden cards from what players CHOSE to ask, not just legality.

THE GAP THIS FILLS
------------------
v0.3's belief tracker extracts from an ask exactly three hard facts: the asker
held at least one card of that half-suit, the asker did not hold the asked card,
and the target did or did not have it. All three are consequences of the rules.
None of them uses the fact that the asker *chose* that half-suit out of the
several they could legally have asked in.

That choice is informative. Under the simplest defensible model of how a player
picks - proportional to how many cards of a half-suit they hold - the
probability of the observed choice is

    P(ask in H | hand) = depth_H(hand) / |hand|

and the denominator is public, so it is the same in every candidate world and
cancels. The likelihood of the whole observed ask sequence is therefore
proportional to a product of depths, one factor per ask, which turns "who asked
where" into a soft weight over worlds.

WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO PUT IT
-------------------------------------
The likelihood cannot go into the constraint propagator, because it is not a
constraint: it excludes nothing, it only re-weights. It fits naturally into the
importance sampler, which is already carrying a per-world weight, and costs one
integer increment per card during a draw.

HONESTY ABOUT WHAT THIS IS
--------------------------
This is a *model*, not a deduction, and the rest of the engine is deduction. If
the model is wrong the posterior gets worse, and against opponents who
deliberately vary their asks it could be exploited. So it is controlled by a
single parameter ``gamma``, with ``gamma = 0`` recovering the uninformative-
choice assumption exactly, and it is validated against ground truth (the true
hidden hands in simulation) rather than by whether it feels reasonable. See
``scripts4/posterior_accuracy.py``.

A known limitation, stated rather than hidden: depth is evaluated on the INITIAL
deal, not at the moment of the ask. Cards move, so late in a game the two
diverge. Modelling the depth at ask time would require replaying each candidate
world through the whole public history, which costs O(history) per draw instead
of O(1). Measured, that refinement is a null (paper, Remark 1).

WHY AN ASK EARLY IS BETTER EVIDENCE THAN AN ASK LATE
----------------------------------------------------
The model treats every ask as equally informative about depth. It should not.
The hypothesis is that a player asks in a half-suit *in proportion to how many
cards of it they hold* - which presumes they had a choice. Early, with nine cards
across many live half-suits, they do. Late, holding two cards in one half-suit
with most of the deck resolved, legality binds: they ask where they *can*, not
where they are deep, and the same observation carries far less signal about their
hand.

``gamma_schedule`` scales the per-ask weight by where in the game the ask
happened, measured by the fraction of half-suits already resolved at that moment
- a public quantity, recoverable from the log alone.

THE PROFILE IS MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN
-----------------------------------
The first version of this used a symmetric tilt, ``1 + s*(1 - 2*frac)``, picked
for being the simplest thing with the right sign. It is the wrong shape.

``scripts4/choice_curve.py`` fits the exponent directly from self-play: at every
ask it records which half-suits were legal, the asker's initial-deal depth in
each, and which was chosen, then fits ``P(ask in H) ~ depth_H ** alpha`` by
exact conditional likelihood. Over 200 games and 17,005 decisions with a genuine
choice, with standard errors block-bootstrapped over games - which doubles them,
because decisions inside one deal are not independent draws:

    half-suits resolved   0      1      2      3      4      5     6-8
    alpha                 2.00   1.28   1.20   0.68   0.30   0.41  -0.02
    clustered SE          0.08   0.08   0.12   0.12   0.13   0.18   0.16

So against the covariate the model actually uses, the shipped constant is wrong
at both ends and in opposite directions. Pooled, the best constant is
1.207 +/- 0.046.

WHAT THAT DECAY TURNED OUT TO BE
--------------------------------
The first reading was behavioural: late asks carry no depth signal, because
legality binds and a player asks where they can rather than where they are deep.
Refitting on depth AT THE MOMENT OF THE ASK - see the ``"at_ask"`` mode below -
says most of it was not behaviour:

    covariate                 opening   1-2     3-4     5-8    pooled
    initial-deal depth          2.00    1.25    0.52    0.23    1.207
    depth at the ask            2.90    2.32    1.72    1.34    2.195

The decay survives and shrinks. Late asks do carry depth signal, about the hand
the asker held; what decays is how well the initial deal still describes that
hand. Noise in a covariate attenuates its coefficient, and here the noise grows
monotonically with the game - mean absolute disagreement between the two rises
from 0.16 cards to 0.66 - which manufactures a decay out of drift.

That is not an argument against ``gamma_schedule``, it is a better argument for
it. The engine conditions on initial-deal depth, and a covariate that degrades as
the game runs on SHOULD be believed less as the game runs on; the profile below
is a dilution correction for the covariate in use, which is a modest and
defensible thing rather than the claim about player behaviour it was first
written up as. It should also become unnecessary under ``"at_ask"``, where the
covariate does not drift - and if it does not, that is evidence the behavioural
reading had something in it after all.

``ALPHA_*`` below is a weighted quadratic through those seven bands (chi-square
8.3 on 4 dof), clamped flat past its vertex because past there the parabola
turns up and the measurements do not. ``gamma_schedule`` is the strength with
which that profile replaces the constant:

    gamma_eff(ask) = gamma * [(1 - s) + s * alpha(frac) / ALPHA_MEAN]

``ALPHA_MEAN`` is the profile averaged over the observed distribution of asks,
so ``s = 1`` redistributes the model's belief across the game without changing
how much of it there is in total. That matters: gamma was tuned by duels to a
broad plateau, and this term is a claim about SHAPE, not strength. Confounding
the two would leave a positive result unattributable. ``s = 0`` is the
incumbent, exactly.

    ``card_slot`` maps ``(player, card)`` to the model slot for that player and
    that card's half-suit, which is the form the sampler's inner loop wants.

    ``depth_mode`` chooses what "depth" means for the already-located cards of a
    half-suit, which is the part of the count the sampler does not re-draw:

    ``"initial"``
        cards the propagator has pinned to that player in the INITIAL deal. This
        matches the constraint system, which is stated over the initial deal.
    ``"current"``
        cards the player publicly holds RIGHT NOW. Superficially closer to the
        quantity the choice model is about, and measured to be much worse (see
        the results): it mixes a present-tense count with free cards that are
        being drawn over the INITIAL deal, so the two halves of the depth are
        counted at different times.
    ``"attime"``
        cards publicly located with that player AT THE MOMENT THEY ASKED,
        averaged over their asks in that half-suit. This is the quantity the
        model actually wants, and it is consistent with the free half: a card
        that is still free now was never publicly located, so its holder at the
        time of the ask was whoever was dealt it.

    ``"attime"`` needs one replay of the public log per decision, not per
    candidate world, because only the already-located half of the count depends
    on time. It remains an approximation in one respect: several asks by the same
    player in the same half-suit are collapsed onto one slot, so their per-ask
    counts are averaged rather than kept separate. Measured in play it costs
    $-1.544$ sets per deal-pair over 250 pairs, which is a refutation rather
    than a null.

    ``"at_ask"``
        the asker's true depth at the moment they asked, kept per ask rather
        than averaged. Cards move only when an ask succeeds, and a successful
        ask is entirely public -- card, asker and target are all in the log --
        so

            depth_at_ask(p, H) = depth_initial(p, H) + delta(p, H, t)

        where ``delta`` is the net of that half-suit's publicly transferred
        cards and is the SAME number in every hypothesised world. Verified
        directly: 23,268 (player, half-suit, time) triples across six games,
        zero mismatches. So the quantity ``"attime"`` was reaching for costs a
        table built once per decision, not a replay per draw, and it is exact
        rather than approximate.

        The covariate matters more than the implementation detail suggests.
        Refitting the choice model on 17,005 real decisions, at-ask-time depth
        beats initial-deal depth by 4,654 nats: the shipped covariate captures
        under a quarter of the signal the same one-parameter family can reach
        (1,403 nats above uniform against 6,057). The two diverge exactly as the
        game runs on -- mean absolute disagreement 0.16 cards at the opening
        against 0.66 by the endgame -- which also means much of the apparent
        decay of the fitted exponent over a game is regression dilution in the
        old covariate rather than a change in behaviour.

    ``count_mode`` decides how repeated asks in the same half-suit accumulate.
    Under the choice model each ask is an independent draw, so the likelihood is
    the depth raised to the number of asks: that is ``"linear"``, and it is the
    principled reading. But asks in one half-suit are plainly *not* independent
    - a player keeps working a suit because they are working it - so the linear
    form over-counts correlated evidence. ``"sqrt"`` and ``"capped"`` are the
    two obvious hedges, and which is right is an empirical question.
