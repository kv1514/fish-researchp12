"""Posterior over hidden hands: exact where possible, unbiased everywhere.

This is the v0.4 replacement for v0.3's sampled beliefs. It sits on top of the
v0.3 constraint propagator (``fish.beliefs.BeliefState``), which is sound and
well tested, and replaces the *inference* layer:

  v0.3                                v0.4
  ----                                ----
  heuristic sampler, non-uniform      exact DP when no OR clause is active,
                                      unbiased importance sampling otherwise
  marginals from 32 draws             closed form, or weighted draws with a
                                      reported effective sample size
  claim probability from 32 draws     exact whenever the clause set is empty,
                                      and exactly 0/1 whenever deduction
                                      settles it either way
  bias never quantified               bias eliminated; every approximation is
                                      counted in ``PosteriorStats``

THE SPLIT, AND WHY IT IS WHERE IT IS
------------------------------------
The constraint system has two parts. Candidate masks plus exact per-player deal
counts are solved *exactly* by the dynamic program in ``counting.py``. The OR
clauses ("the asker held at least one card of that half-suit at the time") are
not absorbed by that DP, and three measurements decided how to handle them:

* Ignoring them is not an option: on 40 real positions the OR-free exact
  marginals were off by a mean L1 of 0.127 per card against the OR-conditioned
  truth, worse than v0.3's biased sampler at 0.074.
* Rejection is not an option: measured acceptance was mean 0.30, median 0.18,
  and below 0.05 on 16% of positions.
* Folding them into the DP exactly needs the mask groups refined by OR
  membership, whose state space has a bad tail (median 5,760, p99 27,000,000).

So: exact DP when no clause is active, and the importance sampler of ``sis.py``
when one is - which is unbiased, has a measured ESS/N around 0.8, and reaches
every consistent world (all three properties are checked against exhaustive
enumeration in ``tests4/test_sis.py``).

        The JOINT, not the product of per-card marginals.

        ``claim4.best_for_half_suit`` returns a pair -- the probability that a
        specific split is right, and the probability the half-suit is ours at
        all -- and ``forced_claim`` scores a declaration with both, as
        ``p_exact - (1 - p_team)``. Under the legacy null variant the two
        carried EQUAL weight in that ranking; under the opponent-award
        baseline ``p_team`` cancels out of it entirely (every wrong outcome
        costs the same set), so this joint query now serves diagnostics and
        the null-variant path rather than the shipped forced ranking. The first came from this posterior; the
        second was ``prod(sum of team marginals per card)``, an independence
        product over cards that compete for the same quota slots. The same
        method's own docstring says three lines earlier that the product of
        marginals is not the joint, which is precisely why the MAP split is
        shortlisted on marginals and then SCORED on the posterior.

        Mixing the two is worse than using either twice: the difference
        ``p_team - p_exact`` is read as "ours but wrongly split" and can come
        out negative, which is only hidden by a clamp.

        On the exact path this enumerates team-only assignments of the cards
        that are not already pinned; the cap keeps a rare wide half-suit from
        costing hundreds of dynamic programs, and falling back to the product
        is counted in ``PosteriorStats.capped_set_queries`` rather than passed
        off as the joint. On the sampling path it is one vectorised pass over
        the weighted draws -- the same estimator ``prob_assignment`` uses, and
        no more expensive.
