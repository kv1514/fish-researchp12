"""Exact endgame play for v0.4, on the wider and faster solver.

WHAT CHANGES FROM v0.3
----------------------
v0.3 solved a position exactly when the agent's own beliefs pinned every live
card, using a solver that enumerated card placements and therefore stopped at
one unresolved half-suit. Two things improve here, and both matter in play
rather than only on paper.

**Speed.** The count abstraction in ``exact2`` (the perfect-information value of
a position depends only on how many cards of each live half-suit each player
holds, never on which ones) shrinks a one-half-suit layer from 279,936 card
placements to 2,772 abstract states. Measured on the same position, 0.051s
against 1.774s: a 35x speedup on what profiling showed to be roughly 40% of the
policy's runtime.

**Correctness in a loopy game.** Fish's state graph is cyclic, and in a cyclic
game Bellman-optimality is NOT optimality: if a side can force +1, every action
that keeps the value at +1 looks optimal, including one that walks a cycle
forever and actually banks nothing. ``exact2`` carries an attractor rank so the
favoured side must strictly descend it, and this module asks for a
progress-optimal action rather than merely a Bellman-optimal one.

LEAK-FREE BY CONSTRUCTION
-------------------------
Unchanged from v0.3, and worth restating because it is the part that could
quietly become a leak. The state handed to the solver is reconstructed from the
agent's beliefs, which come only from public events plus the agent's own hand.
It is used only when those beliefs pin EVERY live card, in which case the
reconstruction happens to equal the true state -- but the agent got there by a
deduction any player at the table could perform. The reconstruction additionally
refuses unless it reproduces every public hand count and the agent's own hand.

    half-suits, not cards: resolved half-suits are stripped from every hand, so
    the number of live cards is always exactly six times the number of
    unresolved half-suits, which makes any threshold between 6 and 11 the same
