"""Dylan's FishBot v0.7 (github.com/dylann4500/fishbot), bridged into our engine.

The bot itself is untouched: the frozen ``fishbot_v07.json`` spec — the full
55-coordinate ``allparamsSpec`` vector plus the det=12 test-time search — runs
in their own C++ code, compiled from their tree into a one-shot ``decide``
binary (``external_v07/shim_decide.cpp``).  This file only translates.

STATELESS BY CONSTRUCTION
-------------------------
Each ``act`` spawns the binary, replays the WHOLE public history into it, asks
for one decision and exits.  That is not laziness: our website reconstructs
every session from the public log on every request, so a stateful bridge would
be a second source of truth that could drift from the first.  A replay costs a
few hundred events through a C++ belief — well under the price of one of our
own decisions.

WHAT IS TRANSLATED, AND WHAT IS NOT
-----------------------------------
* Cards.  Both engines encode ``card = set*6 + index`` but order the sets and
  the specials differently; ``_OURS_TO_THEIRS`` is the exact name-keyed
  bijection, built once and checked to be one (54 distinct images, set
  structure preserved).
* Seats and teams are identical (0-5, parity teams) — no translation.
* Events.  Our AskEvent/ClaimEvent/PassEvent map onto their Event kinds.  Two
  honest losses of information for their side, both disclosed rather than
  patched around: our ClaimEvent reveals the true holders even when the claim
  fails, and their Event format cannot carry that, so their belief learns only
  what their own game would have told it; and their out-of-turn declaration
  channel is never polled, because our rules do not have one.
* The forced declaration.  When a seat holds only complete sets it must
  declare, and the DRIVER picks which half-suit.  Theirs takes the first live
  one the mover holds a card in; ours took the first live one, period, which
  periodically asked their ``bestGuess`` to name owners in a half-suit it held
  nothing of.  See ``_forced_half_suit``.  This was a bridge defect biased in
  our favour and it is fixed; the published margin was re-measured after.
* Rules.  Their agent is constructed with ``outOfTurnDeclare=0`` so its own
  view of the rules matches the game it is actually playing.  Since the
  misdeclaration rule flipped to the opponent-award baseline, the two engines
  agree on what a wrong declaration costs -- their policy's native risk model
  is now exactly the rule it plays under.  (Games before the flip scored a
  within-team misdeclaration as a void here where their engine expected an
  award; that disclosed divergence is gone.)

LEGALITY IS VERIFIED, NOT ASSUMED
---------------------------------
Every action their side proposes is checked against our engine's own legality
lists before it is played.  A proposal that fails the check is replaced by a
fallback and COUNTED on ``self.fallbacks`` — a bridge that silently substituted
moves would be misrepresenting their bot, so the verification harness requires
that counter to be zero before any result is reported.
