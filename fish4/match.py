"""Duplicate-deal matches spanning v0.3 and v0.4 agents.

A thin, self-contained copy of the v0.3 pairing protocol whose worker function
lives in a module that imports ``registry4``. That matters on Windows, where
multiprocessing uses spawn: the worker re-imports the module holding the
function it was given, so the v0.4 agents are only constructible in a worker if
the worker's entry point is here rather than in ``fish.eval.tournament``.

Pairing protocol (unchanged from v0.3, because it is correct): every deal is
played twice with the teams swapped, on the same cards, the same rotated
starting seat, and the same agent RNG seed. Only the policy assignment differs,
so per-pair set differentials are i.i.d. across deals.
