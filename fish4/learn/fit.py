"""Paired regression of the ask objective.

THE MODEL
---------
The v0.4 objective is linear by construction (``fish4.askfeat.score_asks``):

    score(a) = P(success | a) + sum_j w_j * f_j(a)

so the thing to learn is the vector ``w`` over ``fish4.askfeat.TERM_NAMES``. Let
``Qhat(a)`` be the CRN rollout estimate of an ask's value (``rollout.py``). For
candidates ``a``, ``a'`` in the SAME position,

    Delta_Q = Qhat(a) - Qhat(a'),   Delta_p = p(a) - p(a'),
    Delta_f = f(a) - f(a')

and the regression is

    Delta_Q - Delta_p  =  Delta_f . w  +  error.

Three things about that equation are load-bearing.

**Differencing removes the position.** A position's own value level - who is
ahead, how many sets are left - is the dominant source of variance in ``Qhat``
and is completely uninformative about which ask to pick. It is a per-position
intercept, and it vanishes exactly under differencing. There is deliberately no
intercept term in the fit: the data are antisymmetric, so an intercept would
have to be zero anyway, and each unordered pair is used exactly once (including
both orientations would duplicate every row and halve the standard errors for no
information).

**The p_success coefficient is pinned to 1.0.** That is the scale convention of
``AskWeights``: every other weight is read "in units of probability of success".
Pinning it is what makes the fitted vector drop straight into ``FishBot4``. It
is imposed by moving ``Delta_p`` to the left-hand side, so it costs no degree of
freedom and cannot be quietly relaxed.

**Standard errors must be clustered by position.** Pairs from one position share
candidates, share the K determinized worlds, and share the rollout seeds; their
errors are strongly correlated. Naive OLS standard errors treat 15 pairs from
one position as 15 independent observations and are far too small. This module
reports cluster-robust (CR1) standard errors and a position-level bootstrap, and
reports the naive ones only to show how badly they mislead.

WHAT THE FIT CANNOT DO
----------------------
It cannot learn a better ask than the rollout policy can exploit, and it cannot
learn anything about claiming (see the package docstring: claims must never be
selected by determinized search). It also inherits whatever the continuation
policy is blind to. If the fitted objective does not beat the hand-tuned one in
actual play, the regression diagnostics here are the first place to look for the
reason, and ``FIT.md`` records that reasoning.

    below 1. Pinning ``c_p = 1`` does not just rescale the answer: it forces
    every feature that correlates with ``p`` to take a NEGATIVE coefficient
    purely to cancel the overshoot, and those coefficients then look like
    strategic findings when they are an artefact of the scale convention.
    ``claim``, ``certain`` and ``deplete`` are all direct functions of ``p``, so
    this is not a hypothetical failure mode in this basis.

    The ranking a policy actually uses is invariant to positive rescaling, so
    ``b / c_p`` is the ``AskWeights`` vector implied by the unpinned fit, and it
    is a genuinely different candidate policy from the pinned one. Both get
