"""Harvesting real ask positions from v0.4 self-play.

WHAT A POSITION RECORD IS, AND WHY IT HOLDS WHAT IT HOLDS
--------------------------------------------------------
A record is one ask decision actually taken by ``("fishbot4", {})`` in
self-play. It stores everything needed to (a) re-run rollouts later and (b) fit
the objective, and deliberately stores nothing else:

    pid          "<game_seed>:<ply>", unique and reproducible
    game, ply    provenance; ``ply`` is the length of the public history
    seat         the acting seat (also ``turn``)
    rules        RuleConfig as a dict
    set_winner   resolved half-suits at the position
    asks         every legal ask, as ``[target, card]``
    p            P(success) for each legal ask, from the acting seat's posterior
    f            the 10-column ``fish4.askfeat.ask_feature_matrix`` block, in
                 ``TERM_NAMES`` order, for each legal ask
    eval_idx     indices of the asks that the rollout pass will evaluate
    worlds       K determinized worlds, each six current-hand bitmasks in hex,
                 drawn from the ACTING SEAT'S OWN posterior
    banked       set differential already resolved, from the acting team's view
    n_hidden     number of live cards whose location is not yet pinned

**The worlds are stored, not the true hands.** Two reasons. First,
``fish.beliefs.BeliefState`` is anchored on the initial deal and refuses to
attach to a mid-game position, so a posterior cannot be reconstructed after the
fact - it has to be captured while the game is running. Second, storing the
posterior's worlds and nothing else makes the leak-freedom of the whole
downstream pipeline structural rather than a matter of discipline: the true
layout is never written to disk, so no later stage can accidentally read it.

WHICH DECISIONS ARE RECORDED
----------------------------
* the agent actually chose an ASK (positions where it claimed are not ask
  decisions and would contribute nothing to an ask objective);
* at least two legal asks exist (a pair needs two candidates);
* the position is not fully determined. When every live card is already pinned
  there is no hidden information, the posterior is a point mass, all K worlds
  are identical, and every rollout value is the same number - infinite pairs
  with zero variance and zero information. Those positions are skipped, which
  also saves the rollout budget for positions that can teach something.

Sampling is thinned per game (``max_per_game``, Bernoulli ``sample_rate``) so
that positions are spread over game phases and the within-game correlation that
would otherwise dominate the dataset is kept small. The thinning RNG is seeded
from the harvest seed and the game seed only, never from the deal.

FORMAT AND RESUMABILITY
-----------------------
One JSON object per line in ``positions.jsonl``, written by the parent process
only, so there is no interleaved-write hazard. ``meta.json`` holds the config
and the schema tag. Restarting the harvest re-reads the game seeds already
present and skips them, so an interrupted run resumes at the game boundary.
