"""TunedAgent: every strategic hypothesis about ASKING is an ablatable weight.

The strongest agent scores asks as ``P(success) + 0.06 * suit_progress``.
That ignores several things a strong human obviously considers, most
glaringly **who receives the turn when the ask fails**. Two asks with equal
success probability are not equally good if one hands the turn to an
opponent holding nine cards and the other to one holding two.

Each term below is a separate strategy question from STRATEGY_BOOK.md, and
setting its weight to zero ablates exactly that idea, so paired duels and
the exact-agreement benchmark answer "is this real?" instead of "does my
intuition feel right?".

Ask score =        P(success)
  + w_suit    * own depth in the half-suit
  + w_turn    * turn-risk of the target receiving the turn on failure
  + w_reveal  * penalty for exposing a half-suit we have not shown yet
  + w_scarce  * bonus for contested suits our team is winning
  + w_deplete * bonus for draining an opponent toward zero cards
