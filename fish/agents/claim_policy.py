"""Decision-theoretic claim policy.

Replaces "claim when confidence >= 0.97" with an expected-value comparison.
The threshold was the least principled part of an otherwise
belief-driven agent: 0.97 was chosen by intuition, and the right threshold
demonstrably is not a constant. It should depend on:

- the payoff structure of being wrong (null vs gift to the opponents),
- how much the set is worth relative to the rest of the game,
- whether waiting is likely to improve the estimate or lose the set,
- the risk of an opponent claiming first,
- the score (a team that is behind should accept more variance).

EV of claiming now, in sets, from the claimant's perspective:

    EV_claim = p_exact * (+1)
             + p_team_but_wrong_split * (loss_if_wrong)
             + p_opponent_holds_one * (-1)

where ``loss_if_wrong`` is 0 under the baseline null rule (nobody scores)
and -1 under ``wrong_distribution_outcome="opponent"``.

EV of waiting is the same set's value later, discounted by:
- the chance opponents resolve it against us first,
- the chance our information improves (which is what makes waiting good).

STATUS: this model's headline prediction has been FALSIFIED and the module
is retained as an ablation handle, not as the recommended policy.

It derived an optimal claim threshold near 0.70. A direct sweep (150 paired
deals per cell) showed 0.70 is measurably WORSE than 0.97, by +0.45 sets per
deal-pair [+0.18, +0.72], and that any threshold from 0.85 to near-certainty
plays identically. See RESEARCH_LOG.md.

The error is identifiable: ``p_improve`` below defaults to 0.55, treating
the resolution of an unknown teammate split as roughly a coin flip. In real
play, continued asking localizes teammate holdings far more reliably, so
waiting is worth substantially more than this model credits. Fitting
``p_improve`` and ``p_opponent_takes`` from self-play data is the concrete
fix; until then the fixed-threshold policy is the better default.
