"""Live coaching: advise a human during a real game of Fish.

The player tells us their seat and their dealt hand, then logs each public
event as it happens at the table (who asked whom for what, and whether they
got it; who claimed what and how it resolved). From that we rebuild exactly
the Observation that player legally has and recommend a move.

This works because of the fact the whole engine is built on: every card
movement in Literature is public. The player's own hand plus the public
record is enough to reconstruct their entire legal view, which is precisely
what ``Observation.reconstruct`` does. Nothing here needs the real deal, and
the advice is available to any human who tracks the same public information.

The session is a small state machine over the event log, so "undo" is just
dropping the last event and rebuilding.
