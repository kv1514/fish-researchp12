"""Absolute strength benchmark: agreement with EXACT optimal play.

Every other metric in this project is relative ("beats the previous
version"). This one is absolute: in positions small enough to solve exactly,
how often does an agent choose a provably optimal action?

Method
------
1. Play real games until only one half-suit remains live and few enough
   cards are on the table to enumerate (<= 9).
2. Solve the position exactly (perfect information, layered value
   iteration).
3. Ask the agent for its action from its LEGAL observation only, and check
   whether that action is among the exact optima.

Honest caveat, stated up front: the exact solution is the
perfect-information optimum. An agent acting under uncertainty cannot always
match it, and *should* not be expected to when information is genuinely
missing. Two readings are therefore reported separately:

- ``resolved``: positions where every remaining card's location is already
  publicly determined. Here hidden information is not a factor, the
  perfect-information optimum IS the optimum, and a strong agent should
  approach 100%. Shortfalls here are real, diagnosable defects.
- ``unresolved``: positions with genuine uncertainty. Agreement is a useful
  comparative signal between agents but is NOT expected to reach 100%.
