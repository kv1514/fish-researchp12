"""Exact belief tracking over hidden cards.

Theory (see SPEC.md section 5): every card movement in Literature is public,
a successful ask names the card and a claim reveals all six locations. So the
current location of any card is a deterministic function of the INITIAL DEAL
plus the public log, and every piece of hidden-state inference reduces to
constraints on the initial deal:

- per-card candidate sets over initial owners (6-bit masks),
- exact per-player initial hand sizes (8 or 9),
- OR-constraints "at least one of these cards was initially player p's"
  (from "asker must hold a card of the half-suit"),

all maintained incrementally from public events (plus the observer's own
hand, which pins its own cards). A randomized sampler draws full deals
consistent with all constraints, yielding both marginal probabilities and
determinizations for search agents.

SOUNDNESS vs COMPLETENESS (be precise about which we have):

- SOUND: every fact this engine asserts as certain is genuinely implied by
  public information. The true world is never excluded from the support.
  Tested by (a) truth-in-support checks at every step for all six seats plus
  an external spectator, and (b) independent replay-validation of sampled
  worlds against the whole public history.
- NOT FULLY COMPLETE: propagation runs candidate-set filtering, exact
  per-player count reasoning, OR unit-propagation, OR subsumption, and a
  disjoint-OR pigeonhole rule. It is NOT full arc-consistency over the
  combined constraint system, so exotic positions can hold a logically
  certain fact that the propagator leaves merely "very likely". Such facts
  still show up as ~1.0 sampled marginals, so agents lose nothing but the
  proof. Do not describe this engine as complete.

SAMPLING BIAS: the sampler produces worlds that satisfy every constraint,
but not uniformly over the consistent set (OR seeding and quota weighting
skew it). Marginals are therefore good heuristic estimates, not exact
posteriors. Correcting this (importance weighting or MCMC refinement) is an
open item in RESEARCH_LOG.md.
