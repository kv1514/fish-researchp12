"""KRAKEN v1.0 as a language-neutral decision service.

This is the mirror image of the bridge this project built to run dylann4500's
FishBot v0.7 inside our engine: it lets ANY host -- a C++ engine, a
TypeScript web app, another Python program -- ask this bot for a move without
importing it, sharing a process model, or knowing anything about how it
thinks.

PROTOCOL. One JSON object per line on stdin, one JSON object per line on
stdout, flushed immediately. The process is a loop, so a host may keep it
alive for a whole match (fast) or send a single line and close the pipe
(simple). It holds no state between requests: every request carries the
whole public record, and the bot's belief is rebuilt from it. That is a
deliberate cost -- the host stays the single source of truth about the
game, and a lost or duplicated request cannot corrupt anything.

REQUEST
    {"seat": 0,
     "hand": ["2C", "3C", "AH"],
     "hand_counts": [3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],
     "set_winner": [null, null, 0, 1, null, null, null, null, null],
     "turn": 0,
     "history": [ ...events, oldest first... ],
     "rules": {"wrong_distribution_outcome": "opponent"}}

  seat          which seat we are deciding for, 0..5. Teams are by parity:
                {0,2,4} play {1,3,5}.
  hand          our own cards, as names (see CARD NAMES below).
  hand_counts   how many cards each seat holds now, all six, public.
  set_winner    per half-suit: 0, 1, or null if unresolved. Nine entries.
  turn          whose turn it is; must equal `seat` except for a forced
                pass request.
  history       every public event so far, oldest first:
                  {"t":"ask","asker":0,"target":1,"card":"2H","success":true}
                  {"t":"claim","claimer":0,"half_suit":3,
                   "declared":[0,0,2,4,4,4],"revealed":[0,0,2,4,4,4],
                   "winner":0}
                  {"t":"pass","player":0,"teammate":2}
  rules         optional; defaults to this project's baseline. The only
                field that changes play is wrong_distribution_outcome,
                "opponent" (a misdeclared set goes to the other team --
                standard, and what v0.7's engine does) or "null" (the
                legacy void variant).

RESPONSE
    {"action": {"type": "ask", "target": 3, "card": "2H"}}
    {"action": {"type": "declare", "half_suit": 3,
                "assignment": [0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4]}}
    {"action": {"type": "pass", "teammate": 2}}
    {"error": "..."}                 on a malformed or illegal request

  "declare" is this project's name for the move v0.7 calls a declaration and
  older code here calls a claim; they are the same move. `assignment[i]` is
  the seat declared to hold the i-th card of the half-suit, and every entry
  must be on the declarer's own team.

CARD NAMES. Rank then suit: "2C".."7C" and "9C".."AC" for clubs, likewise
D, H, S; "BJ" and "RJ" for the black and red jokers. Half-suit h contains
cards 6h..6h+5 in this project's ordering; ask for the mapping with
{"op": "cards"} and a full table comes back, so a host never has to
reimplement it:

    {"op": "cards"} -> {"cards": ["2C", ...54 names in index order...],
                        "half_suits": [{"index":0,"name":"Low Clubs",
                                        "cards":["2C",...]}, ...]}

DETERMINISM. A seed may be supplied per request ({"seed": 12345}); with the
same seed and the same public record the same move comes back, which is
what makes a host's replays reproducible. Omitted, a seed is derived from
the history length, so a match is still reproducible from its own log.

    off-turn -- it falls to +1.575. That 0.8-set swing is a rule we were not

    Only CERTAIN declarations are offered here: the answer is a declaration
    exactly when the public record alone pins every card of a half-suit to a
